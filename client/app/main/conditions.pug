      li All livestock are sold subject to seller’s reserve price and attract a  buyer’s commission of 6%. The livestock are for sale and placement in Zimbabwe.
      li Generally if someone is selling we don’t want to leave behind an animal here or there so we prefer whole lots to be taken. However I understand that budgets are limited, and where we can share lots out to multiple buyers we will do. However any choice out of a particular lot will attract a 5% premium
      li If you are the highest bidder and subject to the seller’s reserve being reached and the seller authorising the sale. You shall be notified and The lot shall be knocked down to you. Once knocked down it shall be totally binding on the buyer.
      li The proforma invoice is done once the lot has been knocked down as sold and is due immediately. It is based as follows: Bid price per kg  X Number of head X estimated avg kg or Bid price per head x number of head depending on how bidding was being accepted on the site. Plus 6% commission and 10% margin of error contingency.  Plus any transport if any required. Plus vet and police docs $15.00. Police docs and movement permits are carried out by the seller or RLMS under control of the Department of Veterinary Services under the Ministry of Agriculture and Zimbabwe Republic Police and subject to DVS& ZRP regulations for movement.
      li Your prepayment is done according to a proforma invoice based on the initial assessment of the cattle prior to them being featured on the website.
      li Livestock is authorised for despatch once prepayment has been received.
      li The final invoice is done on weighbridge weights during delivery and actual transport mileages. All livestock go over weighbridge unless stated otherwise  - for example in the case of Breeding bulls and  generally where there is a per head bid.
      li If the final invoice is lower than the prepayment  then a refund will be made within Zimbabwe within three working days. If the invoice is greater, then the shortfall is due from the buyer within the same time.
      li All livestock are sold Voetstoots – ie “as is”. All risk passes from the seller to buyer once the livestock have been loaded and have left the farm/sale point.

If you are the highest bidder and the reserve has not been reached  the seller and the buyer will be notified and either the buyer will increase to meet the reserve or the seller reduce their reserve to meet the buyer or some middle ground in between. The outcome will be communicated to both buyer and seller and the website updated and the lot be knocked down as either sold or unsold.
